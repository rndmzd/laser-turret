# UI Redesign - Laser Turret Control Panel

## Overview

The UI has been completely reorganized for optimal ergonomics and usability. The new layout places critical controls where they're needed most - near the video feed - while maintaining access to detailed settings.

## New Layout Structure

### Two-Column Design

**Left Column (Video + Quick Controls):**
- Large video feed (2/3 of screen width)
- Overlays directly on video for immediate access
- Quick Actions panel below video for at-a-glance status

**Right Column (Detailed Settings):**
- Tabbed interface for advanced configuration
- Full access to all system settings
- Remains accessible but doesn't obstruct video view

## Key Features

### 1. **Video Overlays**

#### Quick Controls Overlay (Bottom Right)
- **🔴 FIRE LASER** button - Always visible, updates in real-time
- **🏠 Home** button - Quick access to re-center camera
- Semi-transparent dark background with blur effect
- Doesn't obstruct video content

#### Movement Pad Overlay (Bottom Left)
- **Auto-shows** when Camera Tracking is enabled
- **Auto-hides** when in Crosshair mode
- 3x3 directional pad for precise camera control
- Integrated step size slider (10-500 steps)
- View video while adjusting camera position
- Center button sets current position as home

### 2. **Quick Actions Panel**

Located below the video feed, provides:

#### Toggle Switches
- 🎯 **Laser System** - Enable/disable laser
- 🔄 **Auto-Fire** - Toggle automatic firing
- 📹 **Camera Tracking** - Enable hardware tracking
- 👤 **Object Detection** - Toggle object detection

#### System Status Grid (2x3 cards)
- **Laser** - ON/OFF status
- **Ready** - Ready to fire status  
- **Fire Count** - Total shots fired
- **FPS** - Current frame rate
- **Objects** - Detected objects count
- **Tracking** - Tracking mode status

All values update in real-time via WebSocket.

### 3. **Detailed Settings Panel**

The right column maintains full access to advanced settings through tabs:

- 📊 **Stats** - System metrics and calibration
- 📹 **Track** - Camera tracking configuration
- 🔴 **Laser** - Laser power and timing settings
- 📍 **Presets** - Position presets
- 👤 **Objects** - Object detection configuration
- 🎯 **Motion** - Motion detection settings
- 🔆 **Exposure** - Camera exposure controls
- 🎨 **Image** - Image processing settings
- 📸 **Capture** - Recording controls

## Design Philosophy

### Proximity to Video
Controls that require visual feedback are now overlaid on or immediately below the video:
- Fire button visible while aiming
- Movement controls usable while watching camera
- Status updates don't require looking away from video

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Quick Actions** - Most common operations, always visible
- **Overlays** - Context-aware, shown when relevant
- **Detailed Settings** - Available in sidebar, organized by function

### Real-Time Synchronization
- All quick controls sync with detailed settings
- Changing laser settings in either place updates both
- WebSocket ensures all UI elements stay current

## Responsive Design

- **Desktop (>1200px)**: Side-by-side layout with video overlays
- **Tablet/Mobile (<1200px)**: Stacks vertically, overlays remain functional
- Video always maintains aspect ratio
- Touch-friendly button sizes (50x50px for movement pad)

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Grid Layout
```css
.main-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(600px, 2fr) 1fr;
    gap: 20px;
}
```

### Overlay Positioning
```css
.movement-pad-overlay {
    position: absolute;
    left: 25px;
    bottom: 25px;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.85);
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}
```

### Status Synchronization
- WebSocket `status_update` event updates both quick and detailed views
- Quick panel elements have `quick-*` IDs
- JavaScript syncs toggle states bidirectionally

## User Benefits

1. **Faster Operation** - Fire laser without navigating away from video
2. **Better Spatial Awareness** - Move camera while watching target
3. **Reduced Clicks** - Common actions accessible without tab switching
4. **Multi-tasking** - Adjust settings while monitoring video feed
5. **Progressive Learning** - Simple interface upfront, advanced features available

## Accessibility

- High contrast overlays with backdrop blur
- Large, touch-friendly buttons
- Emoji icons for quick recognition
- Keyboard navigation maintained for detailed settings
- Screen reader friendly semantic HTML

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Keyboard shortcuts for movement pad (WASD)
- Gamepad support for camera control
- Pinch-to-zoom on video feed
- Picture-in-picture mode for multi-monitor setups
- Customizable overlay positions via drag-and-drop
