# Camera Tracking Quick Start Guide

## What Is Camera Tracking?

Camera tracking mode physically moves your camera using stepper motors to keep objects centered under a fixed crosshair. This is the opposite of traditional crosshair tracking where the camera stays fixed and the crosshair moves on screen.

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Hardware Check

- 2x Stepper motors (NEMA 17 recommended)
- 2x stepper drivers: A4988/DRV8825 (pin mode) or TMC2209 (UART)
- 12V power supply
- Pan/tilt mount for camera
- All wired according to `laserturret.conf` (see `docs/TMC2209_UART.md` for UART)

### 2. Enable Camera Tracking

1. Start the app: `python app.py`
2. Open web UI: `http://localhost:5000`
3. Click **üìπ Track** tab
4. Select **"Camera Tracking (Stepper Motors)"**
5. Toggle **"Enable Camera Movement"** ON

### 3. Quick Calibration

1. Enable object detection (üë§ Objects tab)
2. Place a target in frame
3. Adjust **X-Axis Steps/Pixel** slider until horizontal tracking works
4. Adjust **Y-Axis Steps/Pixel** slider until vertical tracking works
5. Click **Save Calibration**

#### PID Tuning (optional)

- In the same tab, use the **PID Tuning** sliders to set gains
- Recommended start: Kp=0.8, Ki=0.0, Kd=0.2
- Changes take effect immediately and are saved to `camera_calibration.json`

#### Re-center on Loss (optional)

- Toggle "Re-center camera slowly on target loss" to gently return toward home when no target is detected
- When disabled, the camera holds its current position when the target is lost

#### TMC2209 UART users (optional)

- Open the **Hardware ‚Üí Motor** tab to view live TMC2209 register values for X/Y
- Adjust `IHOLD`, `IRUN`, `IHOLDDELAY`, and `TPOWERDOWN` on the fly (per-axis or both)
- Requires `use_uart = true` and correct `uart_port`, `x_uart_address`, `y_uart_address` in `laserturret.conf`
- See `docs/TMC2209_UART.md` for wiring and details

### 4. Start Tracking

1. Enable **Auto-Track Objects**
2. Watch the camera follow your target!

## Safety First

- **Always test movement manually before enabling auto-tracking**
- Use the **Home Camera** button to return to center
- Set appropriate **Dead Zone** (20px recommended) to prevent oscillation
- Install limit switches for additional safety

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Camera doesn't move | Check power, wiring, and GPIO pins |
| Moves wrong direction | Swap motor wiring or invert direction in code |
| Oscillates back/forth | Increase dead zone to 30-40 pixels |
| Not available message | Check `laserturret.conf` exists and is valid |

## Key Settings

- **Dead Zone**: 20 pixels (prevents jitter)
- **Movement Speed**: 1.0ms (balance between speed and smoothness)
- **Steps/Pixel**: 0.1 default (adjust during calibration)
- **Max Steps**: 2000 (prevents over-extension)

- **Motor Tab (UART)**: Quick tuning of `IHOLD`, `IRUN`, `IHOLDDELAY`, and `TPOWERDOWN` and live register viewer (requires UART mode)

## When to Use Each Mode

### Crosshair Tracking (Default)

- ‚úÖ No hardware needed
- ‚úÖ Instant response
- ‚úÖ Good for viewing/monitoring
- ‚ùå Laser must aim at crosshair position

### Camera Tracking (New)

- ‚úÖ Physical precision
- ‚úÖ Laser always aims at center
- ‚úÖ Better for active targeting
- ‚ùå Requires calibration
- ‚ùå Slight movement delay

## Next Steps

- Read full documentation: `CAMERA_TRACKING.md`
- Fine-tune calibration for your setup
- Integrate with laser auto-fire
- Experiment with different detection modes
