| Roboflow | Medium | Very High | Remote GPU | Custom trained models |

Added balloon detection parameters documentation.

### 5. New Section: WebSocket Status Updates

Performance comparison:
- **Before:** ~10 HTTP requests/second, 500-1000ms latency
- **After:** Single connection, <50ms latency, 90% less traffic
- Consolidated status payload details
- Reference to WEBSOCKET_MIGRATION.md

### 6. New Section: REST API Reference

Comprehensive API documentation with 50+ endpoints organized by category:
- **Core Endpoints** - Home, video feed, FPS, exposure stats
- **Camera Control** - Exposure, image params, white balance, recording
- **Crosshair Control** - Position, calibration
- **Tracking Control** - Mode switching, camera tracking, PID, home
- **Object Detection** - Toggle, settings, method switching
- **Motion Detection** - Enable, auto-track, sensitivity
- **Laser Control** - Power, toggle, auto-fire
- **WebSocket Events** - Status update stream

### 7. Enhanced Troubleshooting Section

Added new troubleshooting entries:
- **WebSocket Connection Issues** - Browser console checks, firewall
- **Roboflow Inference Server** - Docker container verification
- **Limit Switch Diagnostics** - Reference to test scripts

### 8. Updated Code Structure

Enhanced code structure diagram with:
- WebSocket support annotation
- Motion package hierarchy
- All laserturret module files
- Socket.IO integration in UI
- Complete directory tree

### 9. Updated Web Interface Features

Added to features list:
- PID tuning controls

- Movement speed initialization

### 10. Fixed Markdown Lint Issues

Corrected all markdown formatting issues:
- Added language tags to code blocks (bash, ini, python, text)
- Added blank lines around list items
- Improved readability and linting compliance
